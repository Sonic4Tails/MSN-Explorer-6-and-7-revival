You may have noticed that your online e-mail has been removed. In order to conserve space, MSN removes your e-mail if you do not check it for 45 days. Once these messages have been deleted, you will not be able to retrieve them again. To avoid this in the future, make sure to check your mail at least once every 45 days. If you have previously moved any mail to your Archived Mail folder, it is still there. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
